# Homemapper

I often tell myself: "I'd love to live somewhere that's 15 mins walking distance from a Waitrose, a Gail's and a Tube stop. I'd also love for my commmute to be 45 mins or less. Oh and it would be great if it had low crime."

So I am making a tool to find all the areas that satisfy these criteria. The idea is that at the end you get a Rightmove link with listings satisfying your criteria.

**It's totally a work in progress.**
